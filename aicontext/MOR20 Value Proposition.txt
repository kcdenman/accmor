## Introduction

Morpheus ($MOR) is a decentralized AI ecosystem that was designed to incentivize the first peer-to-peer network of personal general-purpose AIs that can execute Smart Contracts on behalf of a user, known as Smart Agents. Morpheus implemented a unique decentralized infrastructure that incentivizes community contribution within each layer of their ecosystem. Morpheus utilizes LayerZero OFT and wormhole standards to allow for deployment across various blockchains, natively and has been deployed on Arbitrum, Ethereum and Base chains. MOR20 was subsequently launched, which provides the opportunity for new tokens to be launched using that same tokenomics infrastructure while leveraging the audited technology that powers MOR and the associated smart contracts.

Morpheus identified a methodology to “bootstrap” the liquidity for the project through user contributions. As opposed to traditional projects, where “founders” raise capital for liquidity, $MOR allows users to stake yield generating assiets (such as Lido staked eth aka stETH) and divert the yield to the project in exchange for token emissions. This allows contributors to gain $MOR tokens without ever risking their principle.

## Tokenomics
The unique tokenomic flexibility and builder incentivization are what make MOR20 tokens different. MOR20 tokens utilize fully customizable “pools”, used to emit tokens to specific users or groups. These pools are used to incentivize project activity, like providing capital (i.e. stETH for $MOR) or contributing to the development of the project. Every day, tokens are emitted to each of these pools and can be claimed by the respective contributors. 

Morpheus utilizes the following pools for the $MOR token:
	CAPITAL: Stake yield generating asset (i.e. stETH) to earn a percentage of Capital Emissions
	CODE: Contribute to building the project to earn a % of Code Emissions including: infrastructure development, feature 	recommendations and development, github documentation,  code development, and a variety of other contribution types.
	COMPUTE: Provide compute resources to power the decentralized AI demand to earn a percentage of Compute Emissions
	COMMUNITY: Build smart agents to support the functionality and features within the AI platform, improving the overall offering. 	While collecting fees for utilization of their agent, they also can earn a percentage of Community Emissions
	PROTECTION: Support the auditing and long term protection of the project in the case of any bad actors.

Together, these buckets enable a true community based approach where contributors earn token emissions in a “proof of work” fashion – aligning project and user incentives to create a project in a class of it’s own.

## Value
With MOR20, founders customize token configurations to provide the most value for their project. All MOR20 projects can utilize the “staking” functionality with a yield generating asset to help bootstrap their initial liquidity.

MOR20’s simple, trusted framework aligns value across users, contributors and founders 

## Liquidity

MOR20 deployments allow users to stake their yield generating asset (i.e. stETH) to receive MOR20 token emissions. Staking stETH diverts yield to the MOR20 contracts – without risk to the principle. This yield is initially paired with MOR20 tokens and added to their uniswap liquidity pool. Over time, the yield is partially swapped for the MOR20 token, and additional liquidity is added, which also adds inherent buy pressure on the MOR20 token. 

This is valuable compared to traditional liquidity practices, where founders either provide their own capital for liquidity, or raise capital from initial token sales. This creates a high level of risk associated with large-scale selling from pre-sale investors who provided capital for liquidity.

## Token Development

Token development and audits are generally the most difficult, expensive and time-consuming aspects of a project’s development. Identifying trustworthy developers and reputable auditors is a tall order that usually carries an extremely high cost. To fund this, traditional tokens typically set aside initial tokens that must be sold into the market to pay the high fees. The MOR20 dashboard allows founders to customize attributes or preconfigured smart contracts for simple token deployment, requiring NO CODE DEVELOPMENT.

Within the dashboard, founders can deploy these on the Ethereum and Arbitrum blockchains, with built in LayerZero functionality to add additional blockchains supported by OFT. These contracts and the deployment have been heavily tested and audited, and all information can be found within the Morpheus Github.

## Open Source Contribution
MOR20 is an open-source ecosystem, allowing developers to setup their token however they choose. The ecosystem lends towards community contribution with the “pool” emissions, incentivizing users to build on behalf of the project. Incentivizing the community creates evangelists who identify areas that provide the most value to the project and can execute on them. This flips the traditional paid contributor structure to a “proof of value” structure, based on output. 

Open-source structures allow for rapid innovation and delivery while ensuring product-market fit. Morpheus utilizes Github as a great tool to support this collaboration and management of project advancement.

## Future Proofing

The MOR20 tokens incorporate “upgradeability” features, allowing for long-term feature improvement. As the community continues to build new features, smart contract updates may be required for implementation. One example of this is the new Morpheus staking functionality, which aligns incentives with users who have a long-term vision, rewarding users who delay the claiming of their Morpheus Emissions. 

MOR20 projects choose whether to support upgradeability, which leverage updates made to the native Morpheus $MOR token. Morpheus will never be able to modify a MOR20 contract unilaterally, as this would require signature from the MOR20 contract owner, if they choose to make the upgrades. 

Future-proofing allows MOR20 tokens to be flexible and support the long-term viability of the project. Ethereum for example has made numerous upgrades to their blockchain to support new features and technologies.

## How to Onboard

Getting started is easy! Reach out to someone within the MOR20 channel in the discord for help getting started or move directly to the MOR20 dashboard. The MOR20 dashboard has a testnet option for you to start building your MOR20 ecosystem on the Sepolia networks to test which configurations work best for your project. 

Launching is as simple as setting up your token on the dashboard, deploying, and getting the contract information out to your community. Users will be able to start staking based on the dates you choose during your initial setup.
